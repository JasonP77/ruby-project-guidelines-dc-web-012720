if we did apis

https://api.rawg.io/api/games

def get_api_for_games
    response_string = RestClient.get('https://api.rawg.io/api/games')
    response_hash = JSON.parse(response_string)
    return response_hash 
end 




def logout_user(user = nil) 

    return user = nil 
end 


maybe for deleting a game through profile?? (in customer)

def uninstall_game(game_id) //or by Game.find_by
        game = Profile.find_by((customer_id: cust3.id, game_id: game1.id, time: 10, money: 5.00, review: "This game is amazing.")
        game.destroy 
    end 

def 

def add_game(game_name)
        Game = Game.where(name: game_name)
        Profile.create(customer_id: self.id, game_id: game[0].id)
    end
